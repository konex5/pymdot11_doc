Simulation
==========

You can use the library to focus on iDMRG, however, in our case it is
just a way to initialize the state for the DMRG simulation.

.. code:: ipython3

    from pyfhmdot.entrypoint import infinite_to_finite_ground_state
    
    imps = []
    infinite_to_finite_ground_state(
        imps,
        "sh_xxz-hz_u1",
        {"Jxy": 1, "Jz": 1, "hz": 0},
        {"chi_max": 10, "eps_truncation": 1e-8, "dw_total": 0, "dw_one_serie": 0},
        size=12,
    )
